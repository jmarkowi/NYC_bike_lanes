    "Image augmentation involves altering images that are fed into the neural network model. There are several options, such as mirroring an image (\"horizontal flip\"), shifting, zooming, brightening/darkening, rotating, normalizing, etc. The goal of all of this is to alter images in ways that the model might realistically see \"in the wild\" and artificially increase the size of the dataset.\n",
